"""
Exposes the filter "env_to_dict([only=REGEX_LIST])

This is a plugin that can take the stdout result of running the Bash built-in
`env` command and return a dictionary. This can be used for passing into the
`environment` key in later tasks. This can avoid needing to use the `shell`
module to read an RC file prior to running a command.

Ansible best practices is that you avoid using the "shell" command whenever
possible. This is to avoid problems with pipes, exit codes, etc. It also limits
the possibility of problems related to isolating change conditions when a shell
script is run from within an Ansible command.

`REGEX_LIST` is a list of strings, each of which is a regular expression. If
provided, then only environment variable names which match ANY member of the
list will be returned. This can allow you to avoid passing around unnecessary
or incorrect data. So, if you only want OS_ and NOVA_ prefixed values then
invoke this command like `{{ _my_output | env_to_dict(['OS_.*', 'NOVA_.*']) }}`

For instance, this can replace something like

```yaml
- name: do a thing
  shell: |
    set -e
    source ~/stackrc
    openstack image save --file ~/foo.img foo creates=~/foo.img

- name: do another thing
  shell: |
    set -e
    source ~/stackrc
    openstack image save --file ~/bar.img bar creates=~/bar.img

- name keep doing other things...
```

with the following

```yaml
- name: create openstack image
  shell: |
    set -e
    source ~/stackrc
    env
  register: _stackrc_output
  changed_when: false

- name: extract environment
  set_fact:
    _stackrc: "{{ _stackrc_output.stdout_lines | env_to_dict }}"

- name: do a thing
  command: openstack image save --file ~/foo.img foo creates=~/foo.img
  environment: "{{ _stackrc }}"

- name: do another thing
  command: openstack image save --file ~/bar.img bar creates=~/bar.img
  environment: "{{ _stackrc }}"

- name: keep doing other things...
```
